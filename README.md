PHP Authentication and Session Management
This PHP project provides comprehensive user authentication and session management functionality for web applications. With this library, you can easily implement secure user registration, login, and logout features, as well as manage user sessions to maintain authentication state across multiple requests.

Key Features
User Registration
The library offers a straightforward method for users to register their accounts securely. By providing a unique username, a strong password, and a valid email address, users can create their accounts with confidence.

User Login
Once registered, users can easily log in to their accounts using their credentials. The login process is seamless and ensures that only authorized users gain access to their accounts.

User Logout
When users have finished their sessions, they can log out securely to protect their accounts from unauthorized access. The logout functionality clears the session data, ensuring that users are fully logged out of their accounts.

Session Management
The library manages user sessions efficiently to maintain authentication state across multiple requests. By securely storing session data and utilizing cookies, it ensures a smooth and secure user experience.
